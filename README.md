# Electronic PCB for 8 LED

Electronic circuit project for custom arcade button settings.

## Description

Create a controllable PCB for illuminated arcade buttons purchased on Aliexpress.
When I bought these buttons (https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005004138862262.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.74ad1802Fqb7cV&gatewayAdapt=glo2fra), 
it was impossible to set a fixed color and change it according to the command.

This circuit adapts to the button and allows you to choose and vary its color.
